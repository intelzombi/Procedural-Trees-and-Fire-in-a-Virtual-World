# Procedural Trees and Fire in a Virtual World
This is my Procedural Tree and Fire white paper that I wrote when I was the technical lead on the Smoke Framework project with Intel.  The link that Intel had for this material has gone stale and only has a shortened version available.  

I've done a lot of work since the publishing of this white paper back in 2009.  

I've done considerable extensions to the code base but only the white paper is listed here.  The other repository with the extended code base is presently private. Intel used to have the original Smoke Framework code available but I believe all of those links have rotted. 

Enjoy the white paper.
